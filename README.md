# Project: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

For this project, I have worked with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.

This project is part of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwigwuKwr4LdAhUMI5AKHTuBCz0QFjAAegQIDBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udacity.com%2Fcourse%2Fdeep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893&usg=AOvVaw3OfEe4LlR9h_4vW3TZpE_o) program, from Udacity. You can check my report [here](Report.pdf).



### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

   - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
   - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
   - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
   - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)

   (*For Windows users*) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64)  if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit  version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

   (*For AWS*) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (*To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to enable a virtual screen, and then download the environment for the \**Linux** operating system above.*)

2. Place the file in your working folder where you have kept  Jupyter Notebook Tennis.ipynb , and unzip (or decompress) the file.



### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** or higher, the Banana Collector Environment, download the code from this repository and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Torch](https://pytorch.org)
- [UnityAgents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `banana-rl/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook in your browser which you can use to explore and reproduce the experiments that have been run.
